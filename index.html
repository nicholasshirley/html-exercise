        </header>

        <p>In a small Buckinghamshire village, Matilda Wormwood is a five-and-half-year-old girl of unusual 
        precocity, but she is often ill-treated or neglected by her parents. In retaliation, she resorts 
        to pranks such as gluing her father's hat to his head, hiding a friend's parrot in the chimney to 
        simulate a burglar or ghost, and secretly bleaching her father's hair. Matilda has read a variety 
        of books by different authors, especially at the age of four, when she read many in six months. At 
        school, Matilda befriends her teacher, Jennifer Honey, who is astonished by Matilda's intellectual 
        abilities. She tries to move her into a higher class but is refused by the headmistress, the tyrannical 
        Agatha Trunchbull. Miss Honey also tries to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood about Matilda's intelligence, 
        but they ignore her.</p>

        <p>Matilda quickly develops a particularly strong bond with Miss Honey and watches as Miss Trunchbull 
        terrorizes her students with creative, over-the-top punishments. When Matilda's friend, Lavender, plays 
        a practical joke on Miss Trunchbull by placing a newt in her jug of water, Matilda uses an unexpected 
        power of telekinesis to tip the glass of water containing the newt onto Miss Trunchbull.</p>
